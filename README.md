# Project overview

## Description
This is going to be a web app (later also a mobile app), which is intended for unskilled fucks like me, who just simply can't cook (or don't know what to).

You can use this app to enter your fridge contents and get a bunch of recipes for what can you make, therefore nullifying the issue of you not knowing how or what to make.
